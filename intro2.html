<h3>Consequences of wing coloration for performance and population growth</h3>

The plots below allow you to explore how wing coloration influences estimates of performance and population growth for <i>Colias eriphyle</i> in western Colorado. You can examine both past (since 1950) and future (to 2099) conditions. Data are the output from a model described in <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12953">Buckley and Kingsolver (2019)</a>, which combines biophysical and demographic models. You can visualize annual population growth rate (lambda, where 1= stable population and 2= population size doubling), the hours of potential flight activity, egg viability (%), and mean body temperature (°C).

<b>How does the model work?</b> Microclimate models were used to estimate the environmental conditions butterflies experience and then a biophysical model was used to estimate butterfly body temperatures.  Egg viability was assumed, based on lab experiments, to decay exponentially as a function of body temperature from 1 at 40°C to 0.75 at 50°C. Potential flight time, based on based temperatures suitable for flight, was used to estimate how many eggs a female butterfly is able to lay since they lay eggs singly on hostplants. Survival and reproduction were combined to predict population growth rates. Daily minimum and maximum air temperatures at 2 m above ground for 1950–2099 were projected from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, assuming a mid-range climate warming scenario.
