# RShiny_ColiasModel

RShiny_ColiasModel is an interactive shiny app that explores how wing absorptivity influences the body temperatures of butterflies and the consequences for butterfly populations. This visualization is based on [Buckley and Kingsolver (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12953), and uses a future air temperature projection model from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble.
