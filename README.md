https://huckley.shinyapps.io/rshiny_coliasmodel/

R shiny interactive visualization of Colias butterfly biophysical / demographic / evolutionary model. 
This visualization is based on [Buckley and Kingsolver (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12953), and uses a future projection from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. 
Fitness-related parameters such as population growth rate and Flight activity time of Colias butterflies in Colorado are projected through 2099.
