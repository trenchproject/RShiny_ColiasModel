<h3>Wing coloration can be life or death for butterflies</h3>
Elevating body temperature above ambient air temperature is essential for achieving flight and subsequently many other process required for survival in cold, mountain environments. Sulfur butterflies in the <i>Colias</i> genus live in meadows that reach up to 4000m (nearly 14,000 ft) in the mountains of Colorado. By closing their wings and orienting them like solar collectors, they can raise their body temperatures high above air temperatures. How much solar radiation wings absorb is highly dependent on the number of dark, melanin-pigmented, scales in the butterfly's wing. How dark an individual butterfly’s wings end up being depends on the genes it has evolved to carry as well as developmental shifts in response to the environmental conditions it experiences early in life.

Butterfly species that live in cool environments, like high-elevation mountain meadows, tend to have darker wings. But high elevations can be extremely sunny, and it’s possible for butterflies to get too hot to fly. Overheating is also detrimental because it means females lay fewer high quality eggs. For most of the evolutionary history of these insects, overheating hasn’t been much of a problem for high elevation butterflies — but their story might be different under climate change. Wing coloration is an interesting trait to study in relation to climate change because it has direct impacts on their survival and reproduction in response to both average temperature conditions and thermal extremes.
