<h3>Wing coloration of Colias butterflies</h3>

Maintaining body temperature above ambient air temperature is essential for achieving active flight and subsequently many fitness‐determining processes for montane butterflies. Butterfly body temperature is highly dependent on wing melanism, which determines the absorption of solar radiation. <br>

Exactly how dark an individual butterfly’s wings end up being depends on the genes it has evolved to carry and on plasticity (non-genetic responses to the environment). Butterfly species that live in cool environments, like high-elevation mountain meadows, tend to have darker wings. But some species are also known to be plastic. For them, an individual’s wing color depends also on the temperature it experienced as a pupa. This adds flexibility to butterfly morphology, allowing them to handle seasons that may be warmer or cooler than usual. As a rule, cooler pupal temperatures lead to more wing darkening, and vice versa. <br>

High elevations can be extremely sunny, and it’s possible for butterflies to get too hot to fly. Overheating is also detrimental because it means females lay fewer high quality eggs. For most of the evolutionary history of these insects, overheating hasn’t been much of a problem for high elevation butterflies — but their story might be different under climate change. Wing coloration is an interesting trait to study in relation to climate change because it has direct impacts on an individual’s survival and reproduction. This phenotype thus provides insight into how responses to both chronic temperatures and acute thermal stress have shaped responses to recent climate change.
