<h3>Wing coloration of Colias butterflies</h3>

Maintaining body temperature above ambient air temperature is essential for achieving active flight and subsequently many fitness‐determining processes for montane butterflies. Butterfly body temperature is highly dependent on wing melanism, which determines the absorption of solar radiation. <br>

Exactly how dark an individual butterfly’s wings end up being depends on the genes it has evolved to carry and on plasticity (non-genetic responses to the environment). Butterfly species that live in cool environments, like high-elevation mountain meadows, tend to have darker wings. But some species are also known to be plastic. For them, an individual’s wing color depends also on the temperature it experienced as a pupa. This adds flexibility to butterfly morphology, allowing them to handle seasons that may be warmer or cooler than usual. As a rule, cooler pupal temperatures lead to more wing darkening, and vice versa. <br>
<br>
High elevations can be extremely sunny, and it’s possible for butterflies to get too hot to fly. Overheating is also detrimental because it means females lay fewer high quality eggs. For most of the evolutionary history of these insects, overheating hasn’t been much of a problem for high elevation butterflies — but their story might be different under climate change. Wing coloration is an interesting trait to study in relation to climate change because it has direct impacts on an individual’s survival and reproduction. This phenotype thus provides insight into how responses to both chronic temperatures and acute thermal stress have shaped responses to recent climate change.

<h3>Model description</h3>

This activity visualizes fitness implications of phenological and morphological plasticity of <i>Colias eriphyle</i> spanning 1950 to 2099 in western Colorado. It is based on a biophysical model adapted from Buckley and Kingsolver (2019), which is a combination of microclimate, developmental, biophysical, demographic and evolutionary models. In particular, this activity focuses on variation, plasticity and evolution of solar absorptivity of the posterior ventral hindwings of Colias butterflies – a key trait for adaptation to local climate. Wing absorptivity is determined by the relative proportions of pteridine (yellow or orange) and melanic (black) scales, and ranges between 0.4 and 0.7 with darker color having a larger value. The model considers 1/8° latitude‐longitude (c. 12 km by 12 km) grid cells within Colorado, USA, spanning elevations from 1,200 to 3,200 m, and investigates physiology of Colias in that range.

<h4>Climate data</h4>
Daily minimum and maximum air temperatures at 2 m above ground for 1950–2099 were projected from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. Hourly temperatures were then estimated by a diurnal temperature variation function with sine and exponential components. Temperature and wind speed profiles from weather stations in Colorado were used to scale microclimate variables to plant height of 0.02 m. Additionally, global horizontal solar radiation was computed as a function of elevation, latitude and longitude, which is highly responsible for the butterfly body temperature.

<h4>Colias data</h4>
The temperatures of Colias larvae and pupae were approximated as air temperatures in the shade at plant height.
Butterflies' development rates are dependent on the developmental zero temperature below which no development occurs and the accumulated degree‐days needed to complete development. These parameters were experimentally obtained in lab setting. The larval and pupal temperatures were used to estimate developmental rates and subsequently phenology. <br>

Adult body temperature was predicted from a steady‐state heat flux model developed and field validated by Kingsolver (1983) based on thermoregulatory traits, behavioural posture and environmental conditions. Egg viability was produced as an exponentially decaying function of body temperature from 1 at 40°C to 0.75 at 50°C. A demographic model then translated flight time and egg viability into fecundity. A combination of fecundity and survival rates yielded overall fitness. Lastly, a simple quantitative genetic model was used to predict selection and evolution of wing absorptivity of the following generations.
